The data type of this column is 'float', which allows it to hold both integer and decimal values, providing the flexibility to accommodate fractional points which can be crucial for precise scoring systems.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary purpose of this column is to record the cumulative total of points that an entity has earned over a specified period or across various events or assessments. This could be used in educational settings to track student performance, in gaming environments to record scores, or in any competitive scenario where points are used as a measure of achievement or success.\n\nUsage:\n- In educational systems, 'TotalObtainedPoint' could reflect the total points a student has earned across different subjects or assessments, contributing to their overall grade or performance evaluation.\n- In competitions or tournaments, it could aggregate the points earned in various stages or rounds.\n- In customer loyalty programs, it might represent the total points a customer has accumulated through purchases or activities, which could be redeemable for rewards.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- **Precision**: As a float, this column can store values with decimal precision, which is essential for ensuring accuracy in point calculations, especially when partial points are awarded.\n- **Range**: The float data type typically supports a very wide"

This is crucial for calculating percentages, determining pass/fail status, or adjusting scores based on different weighting systems. It serves as a reference point against which individual or group performances are measured.\n\nUsage:\n- In educational settings, this column could represent the total points possible on exams, quizzes, or projects, helping educators to grade students accurately.\n- In competitions or events, it might denote the highest score achievable, which is essential for ranking participants and determining winners.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- **Precision**: As a float, this column can handle precise values, which is particularly useful when the scoring involves half-points or other fractional values.\n- **Range**: The float data type typically supports a very wide range of values, making it suitable for scenarios where the total possible points could be very high or involve complex calculations.\n- **Non-negative values**: Typically, the values in this column should be non-negative, as negative scores"
